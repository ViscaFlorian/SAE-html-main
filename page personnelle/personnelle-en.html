        <h1>The court</h1>
        <p>Badminton is a sport that can be played in singles or doubles. To play badminton, you need a court 13.40 m long and 5.20 m wide for singles, and 6.10 m wide for doubles. The size of the court changes because in singles, the side lanes don't count.</p>

        <h1>The match</h1>
        <p>A badminton match is played in 2 winning sets. A set is won when one side reaches 21 points, but there must be a two-point difference. There can be two possible endings: if one of the two players is at 21 and the other is at 20, then an extra point will be played until one of the two players has a two-point difference. However, there's a limit: if the players reach 29 equal, then the one who scores the point is the winner.</p>
