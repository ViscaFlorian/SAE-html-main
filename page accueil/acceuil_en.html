            <p> I started school at Naives-en-Blois.<br>From CE1 onwards, my dyslexia and dysorthographia were detected. I had speech therapy until the fourth grade. I also benefited from occupational therapy sessions to enable me to work independently on the computer.<br>In CM1, I moved to the Jeanne d'Arc private school in Commercy.</p>

            <h1 class="h1ScolaritéMain1"> The school</h1>
            <p>I moved to Alsace in August 2016 and joined the Collège Jean-George Reber in Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, from 6ème to 3ème. Unfortunately, COVID-19 arrived in 2020, the year I was in 3ème. I was still able to do my 3ème internship, but exams like the brevet were cancelled. I obtained this diploma by continuous assessment.</p>

        <h1 class="h1ScolaritéMain1"> High school</h1>
        <p>I entered the Lycée Jean-Baptiste Schwilgué in Sélestat in 2nde, during which year I was enrolled in the PEPS section, which allows me to take additional sports classes. In première, I chose to study STI2D, a two-year course.And in my final year, I chose the SIN specialization to continue my studies, as this specialization is based on computer science and electronics.</p>

        <h1 class="h1FuturMain1">My projects</h1>
        <p>For my first year in higher education, I was accepted into a BUT program at the IUT in Colmar, with a major in Networks and Telecommunications. I chose this option to work in IT later on. Originally, I wanted to take a course in cyber security, but I don't know everything there is to know about it, as it's a very complex profession. So I chose the Colmar IUT because in the first year, we study several areas such as networks and telecoms.</p>
